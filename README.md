# 📰 Fake News Detection with NLP & Machine Learning

This project implements a Fake News Detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning algorithms. It classifies news articles as either **FAKE** or **REAL** based on their titles using techniques such as text cleaning, stemming, vectorization, and model training with Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
